Full-Stack Authentication System
This project is a comprehensive, full-stack authentication system built with the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) and TypeScript. It provides a secure and feature-rich foundation for any modern web application, handling user registration, login, session management, and password recovery with multiple authentication strategies.
Features
Email & Password Authentication: Classic yet secure registration with password hashing (bcrypt).
Email OTP Verification: New users must verify their email with a one-time password (OTP) sent via email (Nodemailer) before they can log in.
Google OAuth 2.0 Sign-In: A seamless, one-click login and registration experience using Google accounts (Passport.js).
JWT Session Management: Uses JSON Web Tokens for stateless and secure session management.
Protected Routes: A backend middleware system protects specific API endpoints, allowing access only to authenticated users.
Forgot / Reset Password Flow: A complete and secure flow for users to reset their password via an email link with an expiring token.
Responsive Frontend: A clean, modern, and responsive UI built with React that handles all authentication views.
Full-Stack TypeScript: End-to-end type safety for robust and maintainable code.
Tech Stack
Backend
Node.js: JavaScript runtime environment.
Express.js: Web framework for Node.js.
TypeScript: Superset of JavaScript for static typing.
MongoDB: NoSQL database for storing user data.
Mongoose: Object Data Modeling (ODM) library for MongoDB.
Passport.js: Authentication middleware for Node.js (passport-google-oauth20).
JSON Web Token (JWT): For generating and verifying access tokens.
Bcrypt.js: For hashing user passwords.
Nodemailer: For sending OTP and password reset emails.
Dotenv: For managing environment variables.
Frontend
React.js: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
React Router DOM: For client-side routing and navigation.
Axios: For making HTTP requests to the backend API.
React Toastify: For user-friendly notifications.
React OTP Input: For a polished OTP entry experience.
CSS: Custom styling for a modern look and feel.
Project Setup and Installation
Follow these steps to get the project running on your local machine.
Prerequisites
Node.js (v16 or later)
npm (comes with Node.js)
MongoDB installed locally or a connection string from MongoDB Atlas.
A Google Account for setting up OAuth and Nodemailer (with an App Password).
1. Clone the Repository
Generated bash
git clone https://github.com/Ash22686/Authenticator.git
cd Authenticator
Use code with caution.
Bash
2. Backend Setup
Navigate to the backend directory and install the necessary dependencies.
Generated bash
cd server
npm install```

#### Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the `server` directory. This file stores all your secret keys and configuration variables. **This file is included in `.gitignore` and should never be committed to version control.**

Fill it with your own credentials:

```env
# --- Server & Database ---
PORT=5001
MONGO_URI=mongodb+srv://<user>:<password>@<your-cluster-url>/yourDatabaseName?retryWrites=true&w=majority

# --- JSON Web Token ---
JWT_SECRET=your-super-secret-and-long-key-for-jwt

# --- Email Service (Nodemailer with a Google App Password) ---
EMAIL_USER=your.email@gmail.com
EMAIL_PASS=your16characterapppassword

# --- Google OAuth 2.0 Credentials ---
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your-client-id-from-google.apps.googleusercontent.com
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=GOCSPX-your-google-client-secret
GOOGLE_CALLBACK_URL=http://localhost:5001/api/auth/google/callback

# --- Frontend URL for Redirects ---
FRONTEND_URL=http://localhost:3000
Use code with caution.
Bash
Note on Credentials:
For EMAIL_PASS: You must use a 16-character App Password generated from your Google Account security settings, not your regular password.
For Google OAuth: You must create a project in the Google Cloud Console, create OAuth 2.0 credentials, and ensure http://localhost:3000 is an "Authorized JavaScript origin" and http://localhost:5001/api/auth/google/callback is an "Authorized redirect URI".
3. Frontend Setup
In a new terminal, navigate to the frontend directory and install its dependencies.
Generated bash
cd client
npm install
Use code with caution.
Bash
4. Running the Application
You need two terminals running simultaneously.
In the server terminal, run:
Generated bash
npm run dev
Use code with caution.
Bash
The backend server will start, typically on http://localhost:5001.
In the client terminal, run:
Generated bash
npm start
Use code with caution.
Bash
The React development server will start, and a browser window should open to http://localhost:3000.
You can now interact with the full application.
API Endpoints
All authentication-related endpoints are prefixed with /api/auth. The user profile endpoint is prefixed with /api/users.
